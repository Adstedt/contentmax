# Story 3.6: Scraping Performance Optimizations

## User Story

As a power user,
I want advanced scraping optimizations for handling massive sites,
So that I can efficiently process thousands of URLs with minimal resource usage.

## Size & Priority

- **Size**: M (4 hours)
- **Priority**: P2 - Medium
- **Sprint**: 3
- **Dependencies**: Story 2.3 (Sitemap-Driven Content Scraper)

## Description

Enhance the existing sitemap-driven scraper with advanced performance optimizations, distributed processing capabilities, and intelligent caching for large-scale operations.

## Note on Story Evolution

This story originally covered rate limiting and basic parallel processing. Those features have been incorporated into Story 2.3 (Sitemap-Driven Content Scraper). This story now focuses on advanced optimizations for enterprise-scale scraping.

## Implementation Steps

### 1. **Intelligent Caching Layer**

```typescript
interface CacheStrategy {
  shouldCache(url: string, content: ScrapedContent): boolean;
  getCacheKey(url: string): string;
  ttl: number; // Time to live in seconds
}

class SmartCache {
  private redis: Redis;

  async get(url: string): Promise<ScrapedContent | null> {
    // Check if content has changed since last scrape
    // Use ETag or Last-Modified headers
    // Return cached version if unchanged
  }

  async invalidatePattern(pattern: string): Promise<void> {
    // Invalidate all cache entries matching pattern
    // Useful when site structure changes
  }
}
```

### 2. **Distributed Scraping with Worker Pools**

```typescript
class DistributedScraper {
  private workers: Worker[];
  private loadBalancer: LoadBalancer;

  async distributeWork(urls: string[]): Promise<void> {
    // Shard URLs across multiple workers
    // Monitor worker health and redistribute on failure
    // Aggregate results from all workers
  }

  async scaleWorkers(count: number): Promise<void> {
    // Dynamically scale worker pool based on load
    // Consider memory and CPU usage
  }
}
```

### 3. **Content Diff Detection**

```typescript
class ContentDiffDetector {
  async hasSignificantChanges(
    oldContent: ScrapedContent,
    newContent: ScrapedContent
  ): Promise<boolean> {
    // Detect meaningful content changes
    // Ignore timestamp updates, view counts, etc.
    // Focus on actual descriptive content changes
  }

  async generateChangeReport(
    oldContent: ScrapedContent,
    newContent: ScrapedContent
  ): Promise<ChangeReport> {
    // Detailed report of what changed
    // Useful for tracking content evolution
  }
}
```

### 4. **Adaptive Rate Limiting**

```typescript
class AdaptiveRateLimiter {
  private metrics: PerformanceMetrics;

  async adjustRate(domain: string): Promise<void> {
    // Monitor response times and error rates
    // Automatically adjust scraping speed
    // Back off on 429s, speed up on success
  }

  async learnOptimalRate(domain: string): Promise<number> {
    // Use ML to predict optimal scraping rate
    // Based on historical performance data
  }
}
```

### 5. **Memory-Efficient Streaming**

```typescript
class StreamingScraper {
  async *scrapeStream(urls: string[]): AsyncGenerator<ScrapedContent> {
    // Process URLs as a stream
    // Yield results as they complete
    // Minimize memory footprint for large batches
  }

  async processLargeFile(filePath: string): Promise<void> {
    // Stream process sitemap XML files >100MB
    // Parse and process without loading entire file
  }
}
```

## Performance Targets

- Handle 10,000+ URLs per hour
- Memory usage <500MB for 100,000 URL batch
- Automatic recovery from worker crashes
- 99.9% scraping success rate
- Intelligent retry with exponential backoff
- Zero duplicate scraping through deduplication

## Advanced Features

### Predictive Scraping

- Predict which pages are likely to have changed
- Prioritize scraping based on historical change patterns
- Skip unchanged content based on heuristics

### Resource Optimization

- CPU throttling during business hours
- Memory pool management
- Disk I/O optimization for cache writes
- Network connection pooling

### Monitoring & Observability

- Real-time scraping metrics dashboard
- Performance bottleneck detection
- Automatic alert on anomalies
- Detailed scraping logs with correlation IDs
