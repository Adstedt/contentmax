# STORY-012: Opportunity Scoring Algorithm

**Status:** Ready for Review
**Sprint:** Sprint 7
**Points:** 4
**Priority:** P1
**Dependencies:** GSC Integration (STORY-010), GA4 Integration (STORY-011), Market Pricing (STORY-021)

## QA Re-Review Results

**Date**: January 17, 2025
**Gate Status**: **CONCERNS** (Upgraded from FAIL)
**Quality Score**: 75/100

### Fixes Successfully Applied:

✅ Test framework conversion (Vitest → Jest) completed for unit tests
✅ Interface property alignments fixed between tests and implementation
✅ Missing methods implemented (fetchPricingData, getPriority)
✅ Database table dependencies verified (migrations run successfully)

### Remaining Issues:

⚠️ Test expectation mismatches in scoring calculations (medium priority)
⚠️ Edge case handling: NaN returned for zero volume scenarios (medium priority)
⚠️ One Vitest import remains in integration tests (low priority)

### Recommendation:

Proceed with deployment but prioritize calibrating test expectations and fixing edge cases in the next sprint.

## Dev Notes

### Opportunity Score Formula

```typescript
interface OpportunityFactors {
  trafficPotential: number; // 0-100 based on impressions vs clicks
  revenuePotential: number; // 0-100 based on conversion rate vs average
  pricingOpportunity: number; // 0-100 based on market position
  competitiveGap: number; // 0-100 based on competitor count
  contentQuality: number; // 0-100 based on product data completeness
}

function calculateOpportunityScore(node: TaxonomyNode): OpportunityScore {
  const factors = gatherFactors(node);

  // Weighted scoring
  const weights = {
    traffic: 0.25, // SEO opportunity
    revenue: 0.3, // Business impact
    pricing: 0.25, // Margin opportunity
    competitive: 0.1, // Market position
    content: 0.1, // Implementation ease
  };

  const rawScore =
    factors.trafficPotential * weights.traffic +
    factors.revenuePotential * weights.revenue +
    factors.pricingOpportunity * weights.pricing +
    factors.competitiveGap * weights.competitive +
    factors.contentQuality * weights.content;

  // Categorize opportunity type
  const opportunityType = categorizeOpportunity(factors);

  return {
    score: rawScore,
    factors,
    type: opportunityType,
    confidence: calculateConfidence(node),
    projectedImpact: estimateImpact(node, rawScore),
  };
}
```

### Opportunity Types

```typescript
type OpportunityType =
  | 'quick-win' // High score, low effort
  | 'strategic' // High score, high effort
  | 'incremental' // Medium score, low effort
  | 'long-term' // Medium score, high effort
  | 'maintain'; // Low score (performing well)

function categorizeOpportunity(factors: OpportunityFactors, productCount: number): OpportunityType {
  const score = calculateRawScore(factors);
  const effort = estimateEffort(productCount);

  if (score > 70 && effort < 30) return 'quick-win';
  if (score > 70 && effort >= 30) return 'strategic';
  if (score > 40 && effort < 30) return 'incremental';
  if (score > 40 && effort >= 30) return 'long-term';
  return 'maintain';
}
```

### Technical Implementation Details

1. **Composite Scoring Service**

```typescript
// lib/services/opportunity-service.ts
import { TrafficCalculator } from '@/lib/scoring/traffic-calculator';
import { RevenueCalculator } from '@/lib/scoring/revenue-calculator';
import { PricingCalculator } from '@/lib/scoring/pricing-calculator';
import { OpportunityCategorizer } from '@/lib/scoring/opportunity-categorizer';
import { supabase } from '@/lib/supabase/client';

export class OpportunityService {
  private trafficCalc: TrafficCalculator;
  private revenueCalc: RevenueCalculator;
  private pricingCalc: PricingCalculator;
  private categorizer: OpportunityCategorizer;

  constructor() {
    this.trafficCalc = new TrafficCalculator();
    this.revenueCalc = new RevenueCalculator();
    this.pricingCalc = new PricingCalculator();
    this.categorizer = new OpportunityCategorizer();
  }

  async calculateOpportunityScores(nodes: TaxonomyNode[]): Promise<OpportunityScore[]> {
    const scores: OpportunityScore[] = [];

    for (const node of nodes) {
      // Fetch all metrics for the node
      const metrics = await this.fetchNodeMetrics(node.id);

      // Calculate individual factors
      const trafficPotential = this.trafficCalc.calculate(metrics.search);
      const revenuePotential = this.revenueCalc.calculate(metrics.analytics);
      const pricingOpportunity = this.pricingCalc.calculate(metrics.pricing);

      // Calculate composite score with weights
      const weights = {
        traffic: 0.25,
        revenue: 0.3,
        pricing: 0.25,
        competitive: 0.1,
        content: 0.1,
      };

      const score =
        trafficPotential * weights.traffic +
        revenuePotential * weights.revenue +
        pricingOpportunity * weights.pricing;

      // Determine confidence based on data availability
      const confidence = this.calculateConfidence(metrics);

      // Categorize opportunity
      const category = this.categorizer.categorize(score, node.productCount);

      // Calculate projected impact
      const impact = await this.calculateImpact(node, score, metrics);

      scores.push({
        nodeId: node.id,
        score,
        factors: {
          trafficPotential,
          revenuePotential,
          pricingOpportunity,
        },
        category,
        confidence,
        projectedImpact: impact,
        calculatedAt: new Date(),
      });
    }

    // Store scores in database
    await this.persistScores(scores);

    return scores;
  }

  private calculateConfidence(metrics: NodeMetrics): 'high' | 'medium' | 'low' {
    let dataPoints = 0;
    if (metrics.search?.impressions > 0) dataPoints++;
    if (metrics.analytics?.sessions > 0) dataPoints++;
    if (metrics.pricing?.marketData) dataPoints++;

    if (dataPoints >= 3) return 'high';
    if (dataPoints >= 2) return 'medium';
    return 'low';
  }
}
```

2. **Database Schema**

```sql
-- supabase/migrations/[timestamp]_add_opportunity_scores.sql
CREATE TABLE opportunity_scores (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  node_id TEXT REFERENCES taxonomy_nodes(id),
  score DECIMAL(5,2) NOT NULL,
  traffic_potential DECIMAL(5,2),
  revenue_potential DECIMAL(5,2),
  pricing_opportunity DECIMAL(5,2),
  competitive_gap DECIMAL(5,2),
  content_quality DECIMAL(5,2),
  opportunity_type TEXT,
  confidence_level TEXT CHECK (confidence_level IN ('high', 'medium', 'low')),
  projected_impact_revenue DECIMAL(12,2),
  projected_impact_traffic INTEGER,
  factors JSONB,
  calculated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  UNIQUE(node_id, user_id)
);

CREATE INDEX idx_opportunity_scores_ranking ON opportunity_scores(score DESC);
CREATE INDEX idx_opportunity_type ON opportunity_scores(opportunity_type);
```

### Scoring Components

1. **Traffic Potential (GSC Data)**

```typescript
function calculateTrafficPotential(node: NodeMetrics): number {
  const { impressions, clicks, position } = node.searchMetrics;

  // High impressions but low CTR = opportunity
  const ctrGap = Math.max(0, expectedCTR(position) - actualCTR);

  // Position improvement potential
  const positionGap = position > 1 ? (position - 1) * 10 : 0;

  // Scale to 0-100
  return Math.min(100, ctrGap * 50 + positionGap * 2);
}
```

2. **Revenue Potential (GA4 Data)**

```typescript
function calculateRevenuePotential(node: NodeMetrics): number {
  const { revenue, conversionRate, avgOrderValue } = node.analyticsMetrics;

  // Compare to category average
  const conversionGap = categoryAvgConversion - conversionRate;
  const aovGap = categoryAvgAOV - avgOrderValue;

  // Traffic without revenue = high potential
  const monetizationGap = node.traffic > 0 && revenue === 0 ? 50 : 0;

  return Math.min(100, conversionGap * 30 + aovGap * 20 + monetizationGap);
}
```

3. **Pricing Opportunity (Market Data)**

```typescript
function calculatePricingOpportunity(node: NodeMetrics): number {
  const { pricePosition, marketMedian, ourPrice } = node.pricingData;

  if (pricePosition === 'below_market') {
    // We're underpriced - opportunity to increase
    const gap = ((marketMedian - ourPrice) / ourPrice) * 100;
    return Math.min(100, gap * 2);
  }

  if (pricePosition === 'above_market') {
    // Overpriced might be hurting conversion
    return 30; // Still an opportunity to optimize
  }

  return 10; // At market - low opportunity
}
```

### Visualization Integration

```typescript
// Color coding by opportunity score
const getNodeColor = (score: number): string => {
  if (score >= 80) return '#ef4444'; // Red - High opportunity
  if (score >= 60) return '#f59e0b'; // Orange - Medium-high
  if (score >= 40) return '#eab308'; // Yellow - Medium
  if (score >= 20) return '#22c55e'; // Green - Low (performing well)
  return '#6b7280'; // Gray - No data
};

// Size by projected impact
const getNodeSize = (impact: number): number => {
  const baseSize = 10;
  const scaleFactor = Math.log10(impact + 1) * 5;
  return baseSize + scaleFactor;
};
```

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-01-17

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

The opportunity scoring implementation demonstrates solid architectural design with well-separated concerns and comprehensive business logic. The scoring algorithm effectively combines traffic, revenue, and pricing factors with appropriate weighting. However, critical issues were identified that prevent production deployment.

**Strengths:**

- Clean architecture with proper separation of concerns
- Comprehensive scoring logic with multiple factors
- Good TypeScript usage and interface definitions
- Proper RLS implementation in database schema
- Card-based UI implementation (as per user preference)

**Critical Issues:**

- Test framework mismatch (Vitest imports in Jest project)
- Interface inconsistencies between tests and implementation
- Missing database table dependencies

### Refactoring Performed

No refactoring was performed due to critical test infrastructure issues that must be resolved first. The code structure is sound, but fixing the foundational testing problems takes precedence.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: [✓] Well-structured, follows project patterns
- Project Structure: [✓] Correct file organization per architecture docs
- Testing Strategy: [✗] Tests fail due to framework mismatch
- All ACs Met: [✓] All 10 acceptance criteria implemented

### Improvements Checklist

**Critical - Must Fix:**

- [ ] Convert all test files from Vitest to Jest imports
- [ ] Fix interface mismatches in PricingCalculator tests (avgPrice → ourPrice, etc.)
- [ ] Fix property name mismatches in TrafficCalculator tests
- [ ] Implement missing fetchPricingData() in opportunity-service.ts
- [ ] Add missing database tables (search_metrics, analytics_metrics) or update code

**High Priority:**

- [ ] Add input validation to all calculator methods
- [ ] Implement proper error propagation in OpportunityService
- [ ] Add integration tests for database operations
- [ ] Replace alert() with proper toast notifications in dashboard

**Medium Priority:**

- [ ] Extract magic numbers to configuration constants
- [ ] Implement batch database operations for performance
- [ ] Add caching layer for expensive calculations
- [ ] Create composite database indexes for query optimization

### Security Review

**Good Practices Found:**

- Row Level Security properly implemented
- User isolation via user_id constraints
- Proper foreign key constraints

**Concerns:**

- No input sanitization for JSONB factors field
- Missing rate limiting for calculation endpoints
- No audit trail for score modifications

### Performance Considerations

**Issues Identified:**

- N+1 query problem in fetchNodeMetrics()
- Sequential processing of large node arrays
- Missing database indexes for common queries
- No caching mechanism for repeated calculations

**Recommended Optimizations:**

- Batch fetch metrics for multiple nodes
- Add composite indexes on (user_id, score, opportunity_type)
- Implement Redis caching for score calculations
- Use database views for aggregated metrics
