# Story: Bulk Scoring Operations - Performance Feature

## User Story

As a **content manager**,  
I want **to process opportunity scores for thousands of pages efficiently**,  
So that **I can analyze large sites without waiting hours for results**.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**

- Integrates with: OpportunityScorer, batch processing queue
- Technology: Queue system, parallel processing, progress tracking
- Follows pattern: Job pattern similar to metrics sync
- Touch points:
  - Opportunity scoring algorithm
  - Progress tracking system
  - Database batch operations
  - Memory management for large datasets

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. Score 10,000 nodes in under 5 minutes
2. Process in configurable batch sizes
3. Show real-time progress updates
4. Handle failures without losing progress

**Integration Requirements:** 5. Queue-based processing for reliability 6. Parallel scoring with worker pools 7. Database transaction batching 8. Memory-efficient streaming

**Quality Requirements:** 9. No memory leaks with large datasets 10. Graceful degradation under load 11. Resume capability after interruption 12. Progress accuracy within 1%

## Definition of Done

- [x] BulkScorer class with queue system
- [x] Parallel processing with worker pool
- [x] Progress tracking and reporting
- [x] Error recovery and retry logic
- [x] Memory-efficient streaming
- [x] Performance tests with 10k nodes

## Dev Agent Record

### Status: **Completed**

### Implementation Summary:

- Created `/lib/scoring/bulk-scorer.ts` (450+ lines)
- EventEmitter-based progress tracking
- Configurable concurrency (default 5 parallel batches)
- Retry logic with exponential backoff
- Checkpoint/resume capability
- Cancellation support with AbortController
- Real-time progress updates with ETA
