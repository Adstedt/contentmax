# Story: GA4 Analytics Client - Brownfield Addition

## User Story

As a **marketing analyst**,  
I want **to see Google Analytics 4 metrics (revenue, conversions, engagement) for my content pages**,  
So that **I can identify high-value pages and optimize content strategy based on actual business impact**.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**

- Integrates with: Node metrics system in `taxonomy_nodes` table
- Technology: Google Analytics Data API v1 (Beta), TypeScript, OAuth2/Service Account
- Follows pattern: Similar to existing Google Search Console integration
- Touch points:
  - `node_metrics` table for storing GA4 data
  - Authentication system (OAuth or Service Account)
  - Metrics sync job for regular updates
  - Caching layer for API efficiency

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. Authenticate with GA4 using service account credentials
2. Fetch key e-commerce metrics (revenue, transactions, conversion rate, AOV)
3. Fetch engagement metrics (sessions, bounce rate, engagement rate, duration)
4. Support batch fetching for 100+ URLs in single operation

**Integration Requirements:** 5. Store metrics in `node_metrics` table with source='ga4' 6. Implement rate limiting (10 requests/second GA4 limit) 7. Cache responses for 1 hour to minimize API calls 8. Map GA4 landing page paths back to full URLs correctly

**Quality Requirements:** 9. Return empty metrics (zeros) for URLs with no GA4 data 10. Handle API errors gracefully with meaningful error messages 11. Process 200 URLs in under 30 seconds 12. No regression in existing GSC integration

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach:** Use @google-analytics/data npm package
- **Existing Pattern Reference:** Follow GSC client pattern if exists
- **Key Constraints:**
  - GA4 API quota: 25,000 tokens/day, 5,000 tokens/hour
  - Max 10 requests per second
  - Batch requests limited to 50 URLs per filter
  - Landing page dimension uses path only (not full URL)

## Definition of Done

- [x] GA4Client class implemented with core methods
- [x] Service account authentication working
- [x] Batch metrics fetching for multiple URLs
- [x] Rate limiting and caching implemented
- [x] Error handling with GA4Error class
- [x] Tests pass with >80% coverage

## Risk and Compatibility Check

**Minimal Risk Assessment:**

- **Primary Risk:** GA4 API quotas could be exceeded with large datasets
- **Mitigation:** Implement aggressive caching and batch optimization
- **Rollback:** Can disable GA4 sync without affecting other metrics

**Compatibility Verification:**

- [x] No breaking changes to existing APIs
- [x] Database changes - uses existing node_metrics table
- [x] Follows existing Google API patterns
- [x] Performance impact manageable with caching

## Implementation Approach

Based on existing code, here's the specific implementation path:

1. **Create** `/lib/integrations/analytics.ts` - GA4Client class
2. **Create** `/types/ga4.types.ts` - TypeScript interfaces
3. **Install** `@google-analytics/data` and `google-auth-library` packages
4. **Configure** service account credentials
5. **Update** metrics sync job to include GA4 data
6. **Test** with real GA4 property data

## Validation Checklist

**Scope Validation:**

- ✅ Story can be completed in one development session (4-6 hours)
- ✅ Integration approach uses standard Google APIs
- ✅ Follows existing patterns from GSC integration
- ✅ No new architecture required

**Clarity Check:**

- ✅ Story requirements are unambiguous
- ✅ Integration points clearly specified (node_metrics table)
- ✅ Success criteria are testable (200 URLs in 30 seconds)
- ✅ Rollback approach is simple (disable feature flag)

## Story Metadata

- **Created**: 2025-09-03
- **Sprint**: Sprint 2
- **Parent Task**: TASK-004-ga4-client-implementation
- **Estimated Effort**: 6 hours
- **Priority**: P0 - Blocker (revenue metrics critical for scoring)
- **Dependencies**:
  - ✅ Database schema with node_metrics table
  - ✅ Google Cloud project with GA4 API enabled
  - ⏳ Blocks TASK-006 metrics sync job

## Dev Agent Record

### Status

**Ready for Review**

### Tasks

- [x] Install GA4 dependencies (@google-analytics/data)
- [x] Create GA4Client class with authentication
- [x] Implement fetchUrlMetrics for single URL
- [x] Implement fetchBatchMetrics for multiple URLs
- [x] Add rate limiting (10 req/sec)
- [x] Add caching layer (1 hour TTL)
- [x] Create error handling with GA4Error class
- [x] Write unit tests
- [x] Test with real GA4 property

### Implementation Notes

- Use dimension filter with OR expressions for batch requests
- GA4 uses landingPagePlusQueryString dimension (path only, not full URL)
- Must handle path-to-URL mapping correctly
- Consider using runReportRequest for complex queries

### File List

**Created:**
- `/lib/integrations/analytics.ts` - GA4Client class with all functionality
- `/types/ga4.types.ts` - TypeScript interfaces and types
- `/app/api/analytics/ga4/route.ts` - API endpoint for GA4 metrics
- `/tests/unit/lib/integrations/analytics.test.ts` - Comprehensive unit tests

**Modified:**
- `package.json` - Added @google-analytics/data, google-auth-library, p-limit dependencies

### Agent Model Used
