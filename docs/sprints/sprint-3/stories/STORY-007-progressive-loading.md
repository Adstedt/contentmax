# Story: Progressive Loading for Visualization - Brownfield Addition

## User Story

As a **content strategist**,  
I want **the taxonomy visualization to load quickly and remain responsive even with 3000+ nodes**,  
So that **I can explore large site structures without performance issues or browser crashes**.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**

- Integrates with: D3 Force Graph visualization in `/components/taxonomy/D3Visualization/`
- Technology: D3.js, Canvas rendering, TypeScript, React
- Follows pattern: Existing visualization patterns with D3 force simulation
- Touch points:
  - ForceGraph component
  - Node and Link data structures
  - Zoom/pan controls
  - Canvas rendering layer

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. Initial render shows core nodes (<100) in under 1 second
2. Progressive loading based on viewport and zoom level
3. Visual loading indicator shows progress (nodes loaded/total)
4. Smooth transitions between loading levels without jarring

**Integration Requirements:** 5. Works seamlessly with existing D3 force simulation 6. Maintains existing node interactions (click, hover, drag) 7. Preserves zoom/pan functionality 8. Compatible with existing Canvas rendering

**Quality Requirements:** 9. Maintains 30+ FPS during all loading phases 10. Memory usage stays below 200MB for 3000 nodes 11. Loading can be interrupted on viewport change 12. No regression in existing visualization features

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach:** Wrapper around existing node data with staged loading
- **Existing Pattern Reference:** Follow existing D3 visualization patterns
- **Key Constraints:**
  - Must work with Canvas rendering (not SVG)
  - Force simulation needs stable node references
  - Memory efficient for mobile devices
  - Smooth frame rate critical for UX

## Definition of Done

- [ ] ProgressiveLoader class implemented
- [ ] Four loading levels working (core, viewport, connected, all)
- [ ] Streaming/batch loading with frame rate control
- [ ] Visual loading indicator component
- [ ] Integration with ForceGraph component
- [ ] Tests demonstrating 30+ FPS maintained

## Risk and Compatibility Check

**Minimal Risk Assessment:**

- **Primary Risk:** Force simulation instability with dynamic node addition
- **Mitigation:** Add nodes in batches during simulation cooldown
- **Rollback:** Can disable progressive loading via feature flag

**Compatibility Verification:**

- [x] No breaking changes to existing visualization
- [x] Additive enhancement only
- [x] Works with existing Canvas renderer
- [x] Performance improvement, not degradation

## Implementation Approach

Based on existing code, here's the specific implementation path:

1. **Create** `/lib/visualization/progressive-loader.ts` - Core loading logic
2. **Define** loading levels based on importance/viewport
3. **Implement** streaming with requestAnimationFrame batching
4. **Add** viewport detection for zoom/pan triggers
5. **Update** ForceGraph component to use loader
6. **Add** loading indicator UI component

## Validation Checklist

**Scope Validation:**

- ✅ Story can be completed in one development session (4 hours)
- ✅ Enhancement to existing component
- ✅ Follows existing D3 patterns
- ✅ No new architecture required

**Clarity Check:**

- ✅ Story requirements are unambiguous
- ✅ Performance targets clearly defined (30+ FPS)
- ✅ Success criteria are testable
- ✅ Rollback approach is simple (feature flag)
