## Velocity Analysis

### Sprint 6

- **Planned Points:** ~35
- **Completed Points:** ~30 (from planned stories)
- **Additional Points:** ~20 (unplanned enhancements)
- **Total Delivered:** ~50 points

### Sprint 6.5

- **Planned Points:** 26
- **Completed Points:** 13
- **Remaining Points:** 13

## Technical Achievements

### Performance Improvements

1. **Batch Processing:** Handles 14,479+ products efficiently
2. **Async Operations:** Non-blocking imports
3. **Caching Strategy:** 5-minute SWR cache, prefetch on hover
4. **Load Times:** Near-instant after first visit

### UX Improvements

1. **Import Wizard:** Multi-step with real-time progress
2. **Error Handling:** Graceful failures with retry logic
3. **Visual Feedback:** Progress bars, phase indicators
4. **Data Management:** Easy clear and re-import

## Recommended Next Actions

### Sprint 7 Planning

Focus on completing MVP functionality:

1. **Week 1: Metrics Integration (Missing from Sprint 6)**
   - Google Search Console API
   - GA4 Data API
   - Opportunity scoring algorithm
   - Metrics visualization

2. **Week 2: Complete Multi-User (From Sprint 6.5)**
   - Team invitations
   - Role permissions
   - Workspace management

### Technical Debt to Address

1. Component file casing inconsistencies
2. Error boundary implementation
3. Test coverage gaps
4. Documentation updates

## Risk Assessment

### High Priority Risks

1. **No Metrics:** Visualization not actionable without performance data
2. **Single User:** Can't scale without multi-user support
3. **No Monitoring:** Production issues won't be detected

### Mitigation Strategy

- Prioritize metrics integration immediately
- Complete multi-user in parallel
- Add monitoring in Sprint 8

## Definition of Done Checklist

### Sprint 6 DOD

- ‚úÖ Product feed import working
- ‚úÖ Taxonomy visualization with real data
- ‚úÖ Database persistence
- ‚úÖ OAuth integration
- ‚ùå Metrics integration (moved to Sprint 7)

### Sprint 6.5 DOD

- ‚úÖ Settings page accessible
- ‚úÖ User profile management
- ‚úÖ Data source management
- ‚ùå Team collaboration (in progress)
- ‚ùå Role-based permissions (not started)

## Conclusion

Development has been highly productive with ~50 story points delivered in Sprint 6 (including unplanned work). The core data pipeline is complete and working excellently. Priority should now shift to:

1. **Immediate:** Metrics integration to make data actionable
2. **Next:** Multi-user support for team usage
3. **Following:** Production readiness and monitoring

The unplanned improvements (async processing, caching, superior UX) have significantly enhanced the product beyond original specifications, providing a solid foundation for future growth.
