# Multi-User Workspace Support - Brownfield Addition

## Story ID: STORY-003

## Epic: EPIC-002-settings-user-management

## Sprint: 6.5

## Status: Ready for Review

## Points: 13

## Dependencies: STORY-001, STORY-002

## User Story

As a workspace owner/admin,
I want to invite team members to collaborate in my workspace with appropriate roles,
So that multiple users can work together on content generation and management while maintaining proper access control.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**

- Integrates with: workspace_members, workspace_invitations, Supabase Auth
- Technology: Next.js 15, Supabase RLS, Email via Resend, React Hook Form
- Follows pattern: Modal patterns from ImportWizardV2, role-based UI rendering
- Touch points: All existing features need permission checks, navigation context

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements - Team Tab:**

1. Display current workspace members in a table/list showing:
   - Avatar and full name
   - Email address
   - Role (Owner/Admin/Editor/Viewer) with badge
   - Join date
   - Last active timestamp
   - Actions based on current user's role
2. Owner/Admin can:
   - Invite new members via email
   - Change member roles (except owner)
   - Remove members from workspace
3. Invite modal includes:
   - Email input (with validation)
   - Role selector (Admin/Editor/Viewer)
   - Optional personal message
   - Send invitation button
4. Pending invitations section shows:
   - Invited email
   - Role assigned
   - Invited by
   - Expiry date
   - Resend or cancel options
5. Member actions show confirmation dialogs
6. Success/error notifications for all actions

**Functional Requirements - Permission System:**

7. Viewers can only read content, no edit buttons visible
8. Editors can create/edit content but not manage team
9. Admins have full access except workspace deletion
10. Owners have complete control including billing
11. Permission checks on all API routes
12. UI elements hide/disable based on role
13. Workspace selector in header (if user has multiple)

**Functional Requirements - Invitation Flow:**

14. Invitation sends email with secure token link
15. New user clicking link goes to signup/login
16. After auth, automatically joins workspace
17. Existing user clicking link joins immediately
18. Expired invitations show error message
19. Successful join redirects to dashboard

**Integration Requirements:**

20. All existing features check permissions via user_has_permission()
21. Activity logging for all team actions
22. RLS policies enforce permissions at database level
23. Email sending via Resend for invitations
24. No regression in single-user functionality

**Quality Requirements:**

25. Permission checks < 50ms
26. Email sends within 2 seconds
27. Member list pagination if > 20 members
28. Real-time UI updates after role changes
29. Graceful handling of permission errors

## Technical Implementation Details

├── TeamTab.tsx              # Team management main
├── MembersList.tsx          # Current members table
├── InviteModal.tsx          # Send invitation modal
├── PendingInvitations.tsx  # Pending invites list
├── MemberActions.tsx        # Role change/remove
└── RoleBadge.tsx           # Role display component

lib/permissions/
├── client.ts               # Client-side permission checks
├── server.ts               # Server-side permission checks
└── hooks.ts                # Permission hooks
```

### Permission Hook Implementation

```typescript
// hooks/usePermissions.ts
export function usePermissions() {
  const { user } = useAuth();
  const { workspace } = useWorkspace();

  const checkPermission = useCallback(
    (requiredRole: Role) => {
      if (!user || !workspace) return false;
      const member = workspace.members.find((m) => m.user_id === user.id);
      return hasPermission(member?.role, requiredRole);
    },
    [user, workspace]
  );

  return {
    canEdit: checkPermission('editor'),
    canAdmin: checkPermission('admin'),
    isOwner: checkPermission('owner'),
    userRole: member?.role,
  };
}
```

### Invitation Schema

```typescript
const inviteSchema = z.object({
  email: z.string().email('Valid email required'),
  role: z.enum(['admin', 'editor', 'viewer']),
  message: z.string().max(500).optional(),
});
```

### API Route Protection

```typescript
// Middleware for all API routes
export async function withPermissions(handler: NextApiHandler, requiredRole: Role = 'viewer') {
  return async (req: NextRequest) => {
    const user = await getUser(req);
    const workspaceId = req.headers.get('x-workspace-id');

    const hasPermission = await supabase.rpc('user_has_permission', {
      p_user_id: user.id,
      p_workspace_id: workspaceId,
      p_required_role: requiredRole,
    });

    if (!hasPermission) {
      return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Insufficient permissions' }, { status: 403 });
    }

    return handler(req);
  };
}
```

### Email Template (Resend)

```typescript
const InvitationEmail = ({
  inviterName,
  workspaceName,
  role,
  message,
  inviteLink
}) => (
  <Html>
    <Head />
    <Preview>You've been invited to join {workspaceName}</Preview>
    <Body style={main}>
      <Container>
        <Heading>{inviterName} invited you to {workspaceName}</Heading>
        <Text>You've been invited as {role} to collaborate.</Text>
        {message && <Text>{message}</Text>}
        <Button href={inviteLink}>Accept Invitation</Button>
        <Text style={footer}>This invitation expires in 7 days.</Text>
      </Container>
    </Body>
  </Html>
);
```

- [x] Build MembersList with role badges and actions
- [x] Implement InviteModal with form validation
- [x] Create PendingInvitations component
- [x] Add role change functionality with confirmation
- [x] Implement member removal with confirmation

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Team tab shows all workspace members
- [ ] Invite modal sends email invitations
- [ ] Invitations can be accepted via email link
- [ ] Role changes work with proper permissions
- [ ] Members can be removed by admins/owners
- [ ] All UI respects role-based permissions
- [ ] API routes enforce permissions
- [ ] Email invitations send successfully
- [ ] Activity logging captures team actions
- [ ] Workspace switching works (if applicable)
- [ ] Permission system has no security gaps
- [ ] Tests cover permission scenarios
- [ ] No regression in existing functionality
- [ ] Dark theme consistent throughout

## Risk and Compatibility

**Primary Risk:** Security breach via improper permission implementation
**Mitigation:** Database-level RLS, server-side checks, extensive permission testing
**Rollback:** Disable team features, maintain single-user mode

**Compatibility Verification:**

- ✅ Existing single-user functionality preserved
- ✅ Database migrations are additive
- ✅ UI changes follow patterns
- ✅ Performance acceptable with RLS

## Dev Notes

- Start with permission system first - it's foundational
- Use Supabase RLS as primary security layer
- Client-side permission checks are for UX only
- Always verify permissions server-side
- Consider rate limiting invitation sending
- Cache permission checks where possible
- Workspace context should be available globally
- Test with multiple users and roles extensively
- Email templates should work in all clients
- Handle edge cases (owner leaving, last admin, etc.)

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Manual test: Invite user flow end-to-end
- [ ] Manual test: Role changes take effect immediately
- [ ] Manual test: Member removal works correctly
- [ ] Manual test: Permission-based UI hiding works
- [ ] Manual test: API routes reject unauthorized requests
- [ ] Manual test: Email invitation received and works
- [ ] Manual test: Expired invitation handled gracefully
- [ ] Security test: Cannot bypass permissions client-side
- [ ] Security test: RLS policies enforced
- [ ] Load test: Performance with 50+ members
- [ ] Integration test: Email sending via Resend
- [ ] Automated test: Permission calculation logic
- [ ] Automated test: Invitation token generation
