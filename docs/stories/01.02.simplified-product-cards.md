# Story 01.02: Simplified Product Cards for Modal Integration

## Status

Ready for Review

## Story

**As a** user browsing product taxonomy,
**I want** clean, uncluttered product cards that invite interaction,
**so that** I can quickly scan products visually and click to explore details without information overload.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements:

1. **Card Layout Simplification**
   - Remove clutter: Hide availability details, price secondary info
   - **Keep essential only:** Product image, title, price (if available), brand
   - Maintain existing card dimensions (`h-[280px]`) for grid consistency
   - Add subtle visual cue for interactivity (cursor pointer, hover hint)

2. **Visual Enhancement**
   - **Clean hierarchy:** Large product image (60% of card height)
   - **Title:** Single line with truncation, medium font weight
   - **Price:** Prominent but not overwhelming, positioned bottom
   - **Interactive hint:** Subtle "Click for details" text or icon on hover

3. **Click Interaction**
   - Entire card becomes clickable area (not just specific zones)
   - On click: Trigger modal opening with product data
   - **Hover state:** Subtle lift effect (`hover:scale-[1.02]`) matching existing patterns
   - **Active state:** Brief scale animation on click for feedback

### Integration Requirements:

4. **Existing Grid System Compatibility**
   - Cards maintain current responsive grid behavior
   - No changes to parent container layout or spacing
   - Grid gap, responsive breakpoints remain unchanged
   - Zoom functionality continues to work without modification

5. **Design System Alignment**
   - **Background:** Keep gradient `from-[#1a1a1a] to-[#0f0f0f]`
   - **Borders:** Maintain `border-[#2a2a2a]` with hover `border-blue-500/50`
   - **Animations:** Use existing 300ms transitions
   - **Typography:** Follow site hierarchy (white primary, #999 secondary)

6. **Performance Optimization**
   - Remove unnecessary DOM elements and calculations
   - Simplified component reduces render complexity
   - Maintain image lazy loading and error handling
   - Keep existing Product interface compatibility

### Quality Requirements:

7. **Visual Consistency**
   - Cards align with taxonomy category cards' clean aesthetic
   - Hover effects match existing interaction patterns
   - Spacing and proportions follow current design grid
   - Loading states and empty states maintained

8. **Accessibility Preservation**
   - Cards remain keyboard accessible (Tab navigation)
   - Proper ARIA labels and role attributes
   - Screen reader announces clickable nature
   - Focus indicators follow existing patterns

9. **Backward Compatibility**
   - Product interface remains unchanged
   - Parent components (TaxonomyVisualization) need no modifications
   - Grid rendering performance maintained or improved
   - Existing props and handlers work without changes

## Design Philosophy

### Modal-First Information Architecture

Building on the successful ProductDetailModal implementation (Story 01.01), this story extends the **Jira-inspired UX pattern** where cards serve as compact triggers for detailed views:

**Core Principles:**

1. **Low Cognitive Load**: Cards show only what's needed for identification (image, title, price, brand)
2. **Progressive Disclosure**: Detailed information lives in the modal, not the card
3. **Visual Consistency**: 1:1 image thumbnails with white backgrounds (matching modal header)
4. **Click-First Interaction**: Entire card is interactive, making exploration intuitive
5. **Data-First Design**: Clean, scannable layout optimized for quality analysis workflows

**From Modal to Card:**

- **Modal philosophy**: Show data, don't hide it (fixed height, independent scrolling)
- **Card philosophy**: Show enough to decide, then click for details
- **Result**: Fast scanning + deep analysis without information overload

**Professional UI Pattern:**
Following enterprise UX standards (Jira, Linear, Notion):

- Minimal text on cards
- Prominent imagery for quick recognition
- Clear affordances for interaction
- Consistent spacing and typography
- Data hierarchy: Visual → Title → Price/Brand → (Click for full details)

**User Flow:**

1. **Scan**: Quickly browse cards visually (image + title)
2. **Identify**: Check price/brand if needed
3. **Click**: Open modal for comprehensive data analysis
4. **Analyze**: View all metrics, specs, descriptions in structured layout

## Dev Notes

### Existing System Integration:

- **Component Location:** `components/taxonomy/SimpleProductCard.tsx`
- **Integration Point:** Used in TaxonomyVisualization component product grid
- **Grid System:** Maintains existing responsive grid layout and zoom functionality
