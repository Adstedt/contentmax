# Story 01.01: Enhanced Product Detail Modal Component

## Status

Ready for Review

## Story

**As a** product manager analyzing taxonomy data,
**I want** to click a product card and see a comprehensive modal with full product details,
**so that** I can quickly assess product enrichment quality and optimization opportunities without leaving the taxonomy view.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements:

1. **Modal Trigger & Display**
   - Clicking any product card opens a full-screen modal overlay
   - Modal uses fixed positioning with backdrop (`fixed inset-0 bg-black/80 backdrop-blur-sm`)
   - Content container follows existing pattern: `bg-[#0a0a0a] border border-[#1a1a1a] rounded-lg`
   - Modal is dismissible via X button, ESC key, and backdrop click

2. **Modal Header Section**
   - Clean header with product title (large, prominent typography)
   - Product ID/SKU displayed as secondary info (`text-[#999]`)
   - Close button (X) positioned top-right with hover effects
   - Header separated with `border-b border-[#1a1a1a]` divider

3. **Modal Content Layout**
   - **Left Column (60% width):** Product image, description, specifications
   - **Right Column (40% width):** Metrics, quality indicators, actions
   - Responsive: Stack vertically on mobile (`lg:flex lg:gap-6`)

### Integration Requirements:

4. **Existing Modal Pattern Consistency**
   - Follow Mobile Details Modal structure (TaxonomyVisualization.tsx:1457+)
   - Use identical z-index layering (`z-50`)
   - Match animation patterns and backdrop styling
   - Maintain accessibility attributes (role, aria-labels)

5. **Design System Alignment**
   - Colors: Background `bg-[#0a0a0a]`, borders `border-[#1a1a1a]`
   - Typography: White text primary, `text-[#999]` secondary, `text-[#666]` tertiary
   - Spacing: Consistent padding (`p-4`, `p-6`) matching settings tabs
   - Interactions: 200ms transitions, hover effects, accent color `text-[#10a37f]`

6. **Performance Integration**
   - Modal content lazy-loads only when triggered
   - Image lazy loading with error handling
   - Modal state managed without affecting parent component re-renders

### Quality Requirements:

7. **Responsive Behavior**
   - Desktop: Large modal (max-width: 4xl) centered on screen
   - Mobile: Near full-screen with bottom sheet animation
   - Tablet: Balanced sizing with appropriate margins

8. **Accessibility Standards**
   - Keyboard navigation (Tab, Shift+Tab, ESC)
   - Screen reader compatibility with proper ARIA labels
   - Focus trap within modal when open
   - Focus restoration to triggering element on close

9. **Error Handling**
   - Graceful handling of missing product data
   - Image loading failures with placeholder
   - Loading states for dynamic content

## Dev Notes

### Existing System Integration:

- **Modal Pattern Reference:** Follow Mobile Details Modal in TaxonomyVisualization.tsx (lines 1457-1526)
- **Design System:** Use existing color tokens: `bg-[#0a0a0a]`, `border-[#1a1a1a]`, accent `#10a37f`
- **Component Location:** Create new component in `components/taxonomy/ProductDetailModal.tsx`
- **Integration Point:** SimpleProductCard component will trigger modal via onClick prop

### Key Technical Requirements:

- Use React Portal for modal mounting outside parent DOM
- Follow existing pattern: `fixed inset-0 bg-black/80 z-50 flex items-end sm:items-center justify-center p-4`
- Content container: `bg-[#0a0a0a] border border-[#1a1a1a] rounded-lg w-full max-w-4xl max-h-[90vh] overflow-auto`
- Implement click-outside-to-close functionality
- Maintain existing Product interface compatibility

### Testing

- **Test Location:** `__tests__/components/taxonomy/`
- **Test Standards:** Jest + React Testing Library
- **Testing Requirements:**
  - Modal opens/closes correctly
  - Keyboard navigation works
  - Responsive behavior on different screen sizes
  - Accessibility compliance (ARIA, focus management)
  - Error states handled gracefully

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-01-16

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Story Status: Draft - Ready for Implementation**

This story demonstrates excellent technical depth and comprehensive integration planning. The acceptance criteria are well-structured with clear functional, integration, and quality requirements. Strong alignment with existing design system and architectural patterns.

### Requirements Traceability

**✓ AC Coverage Analysis:**

- AC 1-3 (Modal Structure): Well-defined with specific backdrop styling, content layout, and responsive patterns
- AC 4-5 (Integration): Strong references to existing modal patterns (TaxonomyVisualization.tsx:1457+) and design system alignment
- AC 6 (Performance): Clear lazy-loading and state management requirements
- AC 7-9 (Quality): Comprehensive responsive, accessibility, and error handling specifications

**Given-When-Then Mapping:**

- **Given** user clicks product card → **When** modal opens → **Then** displays comprehensive product details
- **Given** user presses ESC key → **When** modal is open → **Then** modal closes and focus returns to trigger
- **Given** mobile viewport → **When** modal opens → **Then** near full-screen with bottom sheet animation
