# Story 01.03: Description Quality Assessment in Product Modal

## Status

Ready for Review

## Story

**As a** product manager focused on content optimization,
**I want** to see description quality analysis and improvement opportunities in the product modal,
**so that** I can quickly identify products needing content enhancement and understand optimization priorities.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements:

1. **Description Quality Display**
   - Show full product description in modal with proper formatting
   - Display quality badge: Poor/Fair/Good/Excellent (following existing color scheme)
   - **Character count:** "150/500 recommended" format with progress indicator
   - **Quality metrics:** Missing keywords, readability assessment

2. **Visual Quality Indicators**
   - **Poor (<100 chars):** Red badge (`bg-red-500/20 text-red-500`)
   - **Fair (100-300):** Orange badge (`bg-orange-500/20 text-orange-500`)
   - **Good (300-500):** Yellow badge (`bg-yellow-500/20 text-yellow-500`)
   - **Excellent (500+):** Green badge (`bg-green-500/20 text-green-500`)
   - Progress bar showing current vs. recommended length

3. **Optimization Recommendations**
   - Display actionable improvement suggestions based on quality assessment
   - **For Poor:** "Add product specifications, benefits, and use cases"
   - **For Fair:** "Include more detailed features and customer benefits"
   - **For Good:** "Consider adding technical specifications or comparison info"
   - Show "Missing Keywords" list when applicable (features, benefits, specs)

### Integration Requirements:

4. **Existing Assessment Logic Integration**
   - Use existing `assessDescriptionQuality(length)` function from enrich-data.ts
   - Connect to existing quality thresholds (100/300/500 character breakpoints)
   - Leverage existing description analysis in `calculateContentMetrics()`
   - Maintain compatibility with enrichment pipeline patterns

5. **Design System Consistency**
   - Quality badges follow existing status badge pattern from category cards
   - Colors match opportunity score indicators (`text-[#10a37f]`, `text-[#f59e0b]`, etc.)
   - Progress bars use existing health score styling
   - Typography hierarchy matches modal content sections

6. **Performance Integration**
   - Quality assessment runs only when modal opens (not on card render)
   - Cache assessment results during modal session
   - Description analysis doesn't block modal opening
   - Graceful handling of null/empty descriptions

### Quality Requirements:

7. **Data Quality Handling**
   - **Missing descriptions:** Show "No description available" with improvement CTA
   - **Empty descriptions:** Treat as "Poor" quality with specific messaging
   - **Very long descriptions:** Handle overflow with scroll or truncation
   - **Special characters:** Properly escape and display HTML entities

8. **Assessment Accuracy**
   - Character count excludes HTML tags and extra whitespace
   - Keyword detection works with multilingual content (your data shows Swedish)
   - Quality thresholds account for product type variations
   - Assessment updates when description changes (future extensibility)

9. **User Experience Enhancement**
   - Quality section is visually separated and scannable
   - Recommendations are actionable and specific
   - Progress indicators provide clear visual feedback
   - Assessment loads quickly without modal delay

## Dev Notes

### Existing System Integration:

- **Assessment Logic:** Use `assessDescriptionQuality(length)` from `lib/core/taxonomy/enrich-data.ts` (lines 487-492)
- **Quality Thresholds:** Poor <100, Fair 100-300, Good 300-500, Excellent 500+ characters
- **Design Pattern:** Follow opportunity score display in TaxonomyVisualization.tsx (lines 1016-1047)
- **Data Source:** `products.description` field from Supabase

### Key Technical Requirements:

```typescript
// Quality Assessment Function (existing)
function assessDescriptionQuality(length: number): 'poor' | 'fair' | 'good' | 'excellent' {
  if (length < 100) return 'poor';
  if (length < 300) return 'fair';
  if (length < 500) return 'good';
  return 'excellent';
}

// Quality Display Component Structure
interface DescriptionQualityProps {
  description: string | null;
  productId: string;
}
```

### Color Scheme (matching existing patterns):

- **Poor:** `bg-red-500/20 text-red-500`
- **Fair:** `bg-orange-500/20 text-orange-500`
- **Good:** `bg-yellow-500/20 text-yellow-500`
- **Excellent:** `bg-green-500/20 text-green-500`
- **Progress bars:** Follow existing health score pattern

### Data Considerations:

- **Multilingual Content:** Handle Swedish product descriptions (observed in data)
- **Character Count:** Exclude HTML tags and normalize whitespace
- **Null Handling:** Graceful fallback for missing descriptions
- **Performance:** Assessment runs client-side, no API calls needed

### Testing

- **Test Location:** `__tests__/components/taxonomy/`
- **Test Standards:** Jest + React Testing Library
- **Testing Requirements:**
  - Quality assessment accuracy for different description lengths
  - Proper color coding and badge display
  - Recommendation logic works correctly
  - Handles null/empty descriptions gracefully
  - Performance impact is minimal
  - Multilingual content handled correctly
