# ContentMax Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals

- Reduce content creation time by 85% for e-commerce marketing teams managing thousands of product pages
- Enable single marketers to manage 1,000+ pages per month through bulk operations and automation
- Achieve 80% catalog coverage with optimized content within 6 months of implementation
- Provide complete visual taxonomy mapping showing content coverage gaps at a glance
- Support bulk generation of 100+ category pages in single operations with smart prioritization
- Enable rapid content review through Tinder-style interface processing 100+ pages per hour
- Improve organic search rankings by 30% through EEAT-optimized content generation
- Deliver measurable SEO improvements within 30 days of content publication

### Background Context

ContentMax addresses the critical challenge faced by e-commerce sites with large product catalogs who lack visibility into their content coverage and cannot scale content creation efficiently. Marketing teams managing thousands of categories have no comprehensive view of which pages have optimized content, which are outdated, or which are missing entirely. This blindness leads to missed SEO opportunities daily as teams work through spreadsheets without ability to prioritize high-value categories or track optimization progress. The platform's unique visual taxonomy mapping combined with bulk content operations solves the core visibility problem while automating the entire editorial pipeline at scale.

The urgency has intensified with Google's increasing emphasis on EEAT signals and the rise of AI-powered search engines. Sites without comprehensive, authoritative content risk losing visibility in both traditional and AI-driven search results. ContentMax provides the first "Content Command Center" for e-commerce, bridging the gap between generic AI writers that lack e-commerce understanding and SEO tools that focus on optimization rather than generation.

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision

The ContentMax interface embodies a "command center" metaphor, providing marketing teams with a bird's-eye view of their content universe through an interactive, game-like visualization that makes managing thousands of pages feel intuitive and even enjoyable. The design philosophy centers on progressive disclosure—showing exactly what users need when they need it—combined with powerful bulk operations that transform hours of work into minutes. Every interaction is optimized for speed and efficiency, from the Tinder-style content review to keyboard-driven navigation, ensuring users can achieve flow state while managing content at scale.

### Key Interaction Paradigms

- **Visual-First Navigation:** Primary navigation through the interactive taxonomy map using zoom, pan, and click interactions similar to Google Maps
- **Bulk Selection Patterns:** Lasso tool for free-form selection, shift-click for ranges, and saved selection groups for recurring workflows
- **Speed Review Mode:** Tinder-style card swiping with keyboard shortcuts (A/R/E) for rapid content approval at 100+ pages/hour
- **Drag-and-Drop Workflow:** Kanban board with draggable cards supporting both individual and bulk movement between stages
- **Smart Defaults with Override:** AI-powered prioritization and auto-approval thresholds that users can adjust or override
- **Context-Aware Actions:** Right-click menus and floating action buttons that adapt based on current selection and user role

### Core Screens and Views

- **Taxonomy Dashboard:** Interactive site map visualization with heat map overlay showing content coverage, with language filter to see coverage per language
- **Content Inventory Table:** Searchable, sortable table view showing all categories/pages with columns for URL, content status (optimized/outdated/missing), last updated date, word count, SEO score, traffic metrics, available languages, and quick actions. Supports advanced filtering by status, date ranges, traffic thresholds, language availability, and bulk selection for operations
- **Bulk Generation Wizard:** Multi-step flow for selecting categories, configuring templates, and initiating batch generation
- **Speed Review Interface:** Full-screen card-based review mode with swipe gestures and keyboard navigation
- **Kanban Workflow Board:** Multi-column board showing content pipeline from Idea to Published
- **Content Editor:** Split-screen editor showing AI-generated content with template structure and live preview
- **Coverage Analytics Dashboard:** Real-time metrics showing coverage percentage, optimization status, and ROI tracking
- **Template Manager:** Interface for creating and customizing content templates with component configuration
- **Integration Settings:** Configuration screens for connecting sitemaps, product feeds, and Google Search Console
- **Content History View:** Version history for each page showing what content was generated, when it was published, performance metrics since publication, and ability to rollback or A/B test versions

### Accessibility: WCAG AA

The platform will meet WCAG AA standards with full keyboard navigation, screen reader support, high contrast mode, and configurable text sizes. All interactive elements will have clear focus states and the speed review interface will offer an alternative list-based mode for users who cannot use gesture-based interactions.

### Branding

Clean, professional design system using the primary blue color palette (#3b82f6) with generous white space and subtle shadows. The interface should feel modern and trustworthy while avoiding overwhelming users with the complexity of managing thousands of pages. Visual hierarchy through typography and spacing rather than heavy borders or backgrounds.

### Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive

Primary focus on desktop browsers (1920x1080 minimum) optimized for marketing professionals working on large screens. Responsive design ensures usability on tablets for executive review and approval workflows. Mobile support limited to read-only views and quick approvals, not full content management capabilities.

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure: Monorepo

The project will use a monorepo structure to maintain all services, shared libraries, and frontend applications in a single repository. This enables code sharing, consistent versioning, and simplified dependency management across the entire ContentMax platform.

### Service Architecture

**Next.js + Supabase Architecture** - Frontend application built with Next.js communicating with Supabase backend services. Supabase provides database, authentication, real-time subscriptions, and storage in a unified platform. Content generation runs through Vercel Edge Functions or Supabase Edge Functions for scalability.

### Testing Requirements

**Unit + Integration Testing** - Unit tests for all business logic and content generation components with minimum 80% code coverage. Integration tests for API endpoints, content generation pipeline, and critical user workflows. Manual testing convenience methods for speed review interface and visualization performance. No E2E testing required for MVP, but structure code to enable future Playwright/Cypress tests.

### Recommendations

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Create POC for 10,000+ node visualization performance
   - Document Supabase rate limits and throttling strategy
   - Define data migration approach for existing sites

2. **Scope Refinements:**
   - Consider deferring workflow automation rules to post-MVP
   - Start with single schema type per page
   - Focus on Category and Brand pages initially

### Final Decision

**READY FOR ARCHITECT** - The PRD is comprehensive and ready for architectural design phase.

## Next Steps

### UX Expert Prompt

Review the ContentMax PRD focusing on the Site Taxonomy Visualization Dashboard and Speed Review Interface. Create wireframes and interaction patterns for these core differentiating features, ensuring the visualization can handle 10,000+ nodes performantly while maintaining an intuitive user experience.

### Architect Prompt

Create a detailed technical architecture for ContentMax using Next.js and Supabase as specified in the PRD. Focus on: 1) Scalable visualization architecture for 10,000+ node taxonomies, 2) Efficient bulk content generation pipeline using Edge Functions, 3) Real-time updates for collaborative workflows, and 4) Component-based content system with Handlebars templating. Prioritize MVP delivery within 4 months.
