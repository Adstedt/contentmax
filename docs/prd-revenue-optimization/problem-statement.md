# Problem Statement

### Current Pain Points

1. **Visibility Gap**: E-commerce teams can't see which categories are underperforming relative to market potential
2. **Analysis Paralysis**: Mountains of data in Search Console/GA4 but no clear action path
3. **Resource Waste**: Teams optimize random pages without knowing ROI potential
4. **Missed Revenue**: Categories with high search demand but poor optimization remain hidden

### Market Validation

- 70% of e-commerce sites have never done systematic category optimization
- Average CTR improvement of 3-4x possible with proper meta optimization
- Category pages drive 60% of organic traffic but receive <20% of optimization effort
