# How ContentMax Aggregates Performance Data

## The Challenge: Making Sense of Product Performance at Scale

When you have hundreds or thousands of products across dozens of categories, understanding performance becomes overwhelming. Which categories need attention? Where should you focus your optimization efforts? ContentMax solves this by intelligently aggregating performance data up your category tree.

## The Core Principle: Sum First, Then Calculate

Many analytics tools make a critical error when aggregating performance metrics - they average percentages. This leads to misleading insights. ContentMax uses mathematically correct aggregation that properly weights performance by actual traffic volume.

### Why Averaging CTR is Wrong

Consider this example:

```
Product A: 10,000 impressions, 100 clicks (1% CTR)
Product B:    100 impressions,   5 clicks (5% CTR)

❌ WRONG: Average CTR = (1% + 5%) / 2 = 3%
✅ RIGHT: True CTR = 105 clicks / 10,100 impressions = 1.04%
```

Product A drives 95% of your traffic but averaging treats both products equally. This would make you think your category performs 3x better than reality!

## How ContentMax Aggregates Data

### Step 1: Product-Level Data Collection

We start with raw performance data from Google Merchant Center for each product:

```yaml
iPhone 15 Pro:
  impressions: 10,000
  clicks: 250
  ctr: 2.5%
  conversions: 25
  conversion_rate: 10%
  revenue: $5,000
```

### Step 2: Bottom-Up Aggregation

Performance metrics flow UP the category tree. Each product's metrics contribute to ALL its parent categories:

```
Electronics > Phones > Smartphones > iPhone 15 Pro
     ↑           ↑           ↑           ↑
     └───────────┴───────────┴───────────┘
         All levels receive this product's data
```

### Step 3: Correct Rate Calculation

At each category level, we:
1. **SUM** all impressions from child products
2. **SUM** all clicks from child products  
3. **CALCULATE** CTR = (total clicks / total impressions) × 100

This ensures high-traffic products have appropriate weight in the category metrics.

## Real-World Example

Let's walk through a complete example with a typical e-commerce taxonomy:

```
Electronics (Major Category)
├── Phones (Sub-Category)
│   ├── iPhone 15: 10,000 impressions, 300 clicks (3% CTR), $5,000 revenue
│   ├── iPhone 14:  5,000 impressions, 100 clicks (2% CTR), $2,000 revenue
│   └── Samsung S24: 2,000 impressions,  20 clicks (1% CTR),   $500 revenue
└── Tablets (Sub-Category)
    ├── iPad Pro: 3,000 impressions, 90 clicks (3% CTR), $3,000 revenue
    └── iPad Air: 1,000 impressions, 10 clicks (1% CTR),   $500 revenue
```

### Aggregation Results:

**Phones Category:**
- Impressions: 17,000 (10,000 + 5,000 + 2,000)
- Clicks: 420 (300 + 100 + 20)
- CTR: 2.47% (420 ÷ 17,000 × 100)
- Revenue: $7,500
- *Note: CTR is NOT the average of 3%, 2%, and 1% (which would be 2%)*

**Tablets Category:**
- Impressions: 4,000 (3,000 + 1,000)
- Clicks: 100 (90 + 10)
- CTR: 2.5% (100 ÷ 4,000 × 100)
- Revenue: $3,500

**Electronics Major Category:**
- Impressions: 21,000 (17,000 + 4,000)
- Clicks: 520 (420 + 100)
- CTR: 2.48% (520 ÷ 21,000 × 100)
- Revenue: $11,000

## Performance Scoring Algorithm

ContentMax assigns each category a performance score (0-100) based on multiple factors:

### CTR Component (30 points max)
- **Industry Benchmark**: 0.86% - 2.5% for Google Shopping
- 2.5%+ CTR = 30 points
- 1.5-2.5% CTR = 20 points
- 0.86-1.5% CTR = 10 points
- Below 0.86% = 5 points

### Conversion Rate Component (30 points max)
- **Industry Benchmark**: 1.91% - 3.5%
- 3.5%+ = 30 points
- 2.5-3.5% = 20 points
- 1.91-2.5% = 10 points
- Below 1.91% = 5 points

### Revenue Component (20 points max)
Based on absolute revenue generation:
- $10,000+ = 20 points
- $5,000-10,000 = 15 points
- $1,000-5,000 = 10 points
- $100-1,000 = 5 points

### Scale Component (20 points max)
Rewards categories with meaningful traffic:
- 10,000+ impressions = 20 points
- 5,000-10,000 = 15 points
- 1,000-5,000 = 10 points
- 100-1,000 = 5 points

## Benchmark Comparisons

ContentMax compares each category against peer categories at the same depth level:

```python
# Example: Comparing "Phones" to other sub-categories
Phones CTR: 2.47%
Peer Average CTR: 1.8%
Performance: +37% above average ✅

Tablets CTR: 2.5%
Peer Average CTR: 1.8%
Performance: +39% above average ✅

Home Decor CTR: 0.9%
Peer Average CTR: 1.8%
Performance: -50% below average ⚠️
```

## Actionable Insights Generation

Based on the aggregated data, ContentMax generates specific recommendations:

### Critical Issues (Red Alerts)
- **Trigger**: High impressions (10,000+) but CTR < 0.5%
- **Example**: "Electronics > Accessories has 15,000 impressions but only 0.4% CTR"
- **Action**: "Urgent: Update titles and images - potential for +225 clicks/month"

### High Priority Opportunities
- **Trigger**: CTR 30%+ below peer average
- **Example**: "Home Decor CTR is 50% below similar categories"
- **Action**: "Optimize product titles to match peer performance for +180 clicks"

### Conversion Optimization
- **Trigger**: Good traffic (100+ clicks) but conversion rate < 1%
- **Example**: "Garden Tools gets clicks but only 0.8% convert"
- **Action**: "Review pricing and descriptions - potential +$2,400/month revenue"

## The Value of Proper Aggregation

### Why This Matters for Your Business

1. **Accurate Prioritization**: Know which categories truly need attention based on their actual impact, not misleading averages.

2. **Revenue-Weighted Insights**: A 1% CTR improvement on your high-traffic category matters more than a 10% improvement on rarely-viewed products.

3. **Realistic Projections**: When we say "fixing this category could increase revenue by $5,000," it's based on actual traffic volumes, not assumptions.

### Example ROI Calculation

```
Current State:
- Electronics category: 50,000 impressions, 1% CTR (500 clicks)
- Peer average CTR: 2%

Opportunity:
- Improve CTR to peer average: 50,000 × 2% = 1,000 clicks
- Additional clicks: 500
- Conversion rate: 2%
- Average order value: $100
- Potential revenue increase: 500 × 0.02 × $100 = $1,000/month
```

)
```

### Aggregation Process

1. **Data Sync**: Fetch latest metrics from Google Merchant Center API
2. **Product Update**: Update individual product performance
3. **Bottom-Up Aggregation**: Sum metrics up the category tree
4. **Rate Calculation**: Calculate CTR and conversion rates from totals
5. **Scoring**: Apply performance scoring algorithm
6. **Benchmarking**: Compare against peer categories
7. **Insights Generation**: Create actionable recommendations

## Best Practices for Using ContentMax Analytics

### 1. Focus on High-Impact Categories
Start with categories that have both:
- High traffic (1,000+ impressions)
- Low performance scores (< 50)

### 2. Monitor Trends Over Time
A declining CTR in a major category is more concerning than a stable low CTR in a minor category.

### 3. Test and Measure
When you optimize content based on our recommendations:
- Record the before state
- Make changes
- Measure impact after 2 weeks
- ContentMax tracks these improvements automatically

### 4. Use Peer Benchmarks Wisely
Being below average isn't always bad if:
- The category is new (< 30 days)
- You're testing premium pricing
- It's a seasonal category in off-season
