summary: |
  Excellent implementation with comprehensive feature coverage, robust error handling,
  and thorough testing. All must-have requirements completed with proper security
  and performance optimizations.

scores:
  requirements_coverage: 95  # All must-have + most should-have completed
  code_quality: 90           # Clean architecture, good separation of concerns
  test_coverage: 85          # Comprehensive unit, integration, and API tests
  security: 95               # RLS, auth, OAuth properly implemented
  performance: 85            # Rate limiting, indexing, batch operations
  maintainability: 90        # Well-organized, documented code
